Linting

Due to its robust compiler, there are mainly two linters in the Rust ecosystem: Rustmft and Clippy. For this project we will use clippy, due to its popularity in the Rust community.

Testing

We will test our software using the test suite built into the Rust compiler. We shouldn't need anything else.

building

For the build, we will follow the workflow of creating Rust libraries.

Alternatives to Jenkins and Github Actions

There are some alternatives to these services. We can highlight CircleCI, Gitlab, RedHat or Azure DevOps Server. As a small team of developers, we will be using Github Actions for our project. Furthermore, we do not need any specific hardware resources and there is no need to incur any further expenses.
